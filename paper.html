            <p>
                They don’t just help you achieve wonderful, toned legs; they promote body-wide muscle building by
                creating an
                anabolic (muscle building) environment in the body. They work up your quadriceps, hamstrings, calves,
                abdominal
                muscles, lower back and your butt too. Not many exercises can claim to recruit so many muscles at the
                same time!

            <h2 id='special'>2. Squats Burn Calories Fast.</h2>
            <p>
                Because they help you build muscle, you’ll become more efficient at burning calories so you can get to
                that
                slimmer
                physique faster. Add weights to your squats and you’ll burn the calories even quicker.

            <h2 id='special'> 3. Squats Help Improve Flexibility.</h2>
            <p> Improving your flexibility should be part of any well-rounded workout training plan. Our muscles,
                tendons and
                ligaments become less elastic with age so doing all we can to slow down this process is a good idea.
                Squatting
                regularly will see you limber up and become more flexible as the exercise involves bending and
                stretching of the
                leg
                muscles.
